BDSP (Binary Data Separation Protocol) | Alpha Version
===========
[![arduino-library-badge](https://www.ardu-badge.com/badge/ToDo.svg)]()


The library implements a protocol for dividing binary data into packets.

We have multiple goals with this library:

* Easy way to use.
* Asynchronous architecture
* Minimal dependencies.
* High performance.
* Possibility of flexible configuration.
* COBS encoding. Low data redundancy.


## Getting Started

ToDo: Install the library using either and.

Here's a simple program (Need to write):

```cpp
#include <BDSP.h>

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop() {}
```

## Help and Support

Need to write

## Supported Platforms

Right now the library is supported on a variety of Arduino compatible platforms.  If it's ARM or AVR and uses the Arduino software (or a modified version of it to build) then it is likely supported. 

* Arduino & compatibles - straight up Arduino devices, Uno, Duo, Leonardo, Mega, Nano, etc...
* ESP8266 and ESP32 based boards

## TODO

* Realize alpha version
